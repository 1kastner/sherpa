# SHERPA
Welcome to SHERPA. Our goal is to give you
fast and easy hyperparameter search for Keras. Hobbit is building on the Hyperband algorithm developed in
> Li, Lisha, et al. "Hyperband: A Novel Bandit-Based Approach to Hyperparameter Optimization." arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.06560 (2016).

### Dependencies
+ Keras 2.0.2 with respective Theano or Tensorflow backend
+ Pandas 0.19.2

Hobbit is compatible with Python 2.7 - 3.4 and can be run on either CPU or GPU. To install, simply clone and add the
hobbit folder to your Pythonpath.
