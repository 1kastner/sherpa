Welcome to SHERPA!
==================

SHERPA is a Python library for hyperparameter tuning of machine learning models.

Its goal is to provide:

* implementations of hyperparameter optimization algorithms
* parallel computation that can be fitted to the user's needs
* a live dashboard for the exploratory analysis of results.

The documentation provides tutorials on parallel computation and different
hyperparameter search algorithms.
