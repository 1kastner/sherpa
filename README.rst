Welcome to SHERPA!
==================

SHERPA is a Python library for hyperparameter tuning of deep neural networks.

Its goal is to provide a platform for the implementation of innovations in
hyperparameter search algorithms. The tutorials section shows how to use some
of the implemented algorithms.

Installation
============


Installation from wheel
-----------------------

Download a copy of the wheel file from the dist folder in
git@gitlab.ics.uci.edu:uci-igb/sherpa.git

Make sure you have the most updated version of pip

::

    pip install --upgrade pip

Install wheel package if needed

::

    pip install wheel

Go to the directory where you downloaded the wheel and install sherpa
from wheel

::

    pip install sherpa-0.0.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl

If you used the wheel to install Sherpa you donâ€™t need to set your
python path.

Installation from gitlab
------------------------

Clone into ``/your/path/`` from GitLab:

::

    cd /your/path/
    git clone git@gitlab.ics.uci.edu:uci-igb/sherpa.git

Add SHERPA to Python-path in your profile:

::

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/your/path/sherpa/

Install dependencies:

::

    pip install pandas
    pip install pymongo
    pip install numpy
    pip install scipy
    pip install scikit-learn
    pip install flask
    pip install drmaa
    pip install enum34  # if on < Python 3.4

Mongo DB
--------

Training models in parallel with SHERPA requires MongoDB. If you are using
a cluster, chances are that it is already installed, so check for that. Otherwise
the  .. _installation guide for Linux: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/
is straightforward. For MacOS, MongoDB can either be installed via Homebrew

::

    brew update
    brew install mongodb

or via the .. _instructions: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/ .



Example
-------

You can run an example to verify SHERPA is working:

::

    cd /your/path/sherpa/examples/
    python api_mode.py

And to verify SHERPA with MongoDB is working:

::

    cd /your/path/sherpa/examples/
    python runner_mode.pyFrom Keras to Sherpa in 30 seconds
==================================

Here we will show how to adapt a minimal Keras script so it can
be used with Sherpa. As starting point we use the "getting started in 30 seconds"
tutorial from the Keras webpage.

To run SHERPA you need a trial-script and a
runner-script. The first specifies the machine learning model and
will probably be very similar to the one you already have for Keras.
The second one will specify information about SHERPA and the optimization.

Trial-script
------------

For the ``trial.py`` we start by importing SHERPA and obtaining a trial. The
trial will contain the hyperparameters that we are tuning.

::

    import sherpa
    client = sherpa.Client()
    trial = client.get_trial()


Now we define the model, but for each tuning parameter we use
``trial.parameters[<name-of-parameter>]``. For example the number of
hidden units.

Before:

::

    from keras.models import Sequential
    from keras.layers import Dense
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=100))
    model.add(Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))
    model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer='sgd',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

After:

::

    from keras.models import Sequential
    from keras.layers import Dense
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(units=trial.parameters['num_units'], activation='relu', input_dim=100))
    model.add(Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))
    model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                  optimizer='sgd',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

For the training of the model, we include a
callback to send the information back to SHERPA at the end of each epoch
so it can update the state of it and decide if it should continue training.
Here you can include all the usual Keras callbacks as well.

Before:

::

    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32)

After:

::

    callbacks = [client.keras_send_metrics(trial, objective_name='val_loss',
                 context_names=['val_acc'])]
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32, callbacks=callbacks)

Runner-script
-------------

Now we are going to create the runner-script and specify our hyperparameter
``num_units`` along with information for the hyperparameter algorithm, in this
case Random Search.

::

    import sherpa
    parameters = [sherpa.Choice('num_units', [100, 200, 300]),]
    alg = sherpa.algorithms.RandomSearch(max_num_trials=150)
    rval = sherpa.optimize(parameters=parameters,
                           algorithm=alg,
                           lower_is_better=False,
                           filename='./trial.py', # Python script to run, where the model was defined
                           scheduler=sherpa.schedulers.LocalScheduler(), # Run on local machine
                           )

And that's it! Now to run your hyperparameter optimization you just have to do:

::

    python runner.py
